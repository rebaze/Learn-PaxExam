/**
 * This is a copy of lesson 1 but with a higher level abstraction on how we interact with TestContainers.
 * In Lesson1 we learned about the lifecycle of TestContainers, and that we need to control it.
 *
 * When writing tests, you may not be really interested into how to start/stop a container (or better: all the containers).
 * You may really want to write a setup where start/stopping is not your job but part of a "strategy".
 * This can be like:
 * - I want a fresh container for every test
 * - I want to reuse containers across tests
 * etc.
 *
 * This is what {@link ExxamReactor} is about.
 * You feed the Reactor with the TestContainerFactory, Configuration (Options!) and Probes.
 * The {@link ExxamReactor#stage(org.ops4j.pax.exam.spi.StagedExamReactorFactory)} gives you access to launching the tests.
 * You don't see (and care) when a container is started and stopped.
