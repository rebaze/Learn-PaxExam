/**
 * This is the latest face of Pax Exam. Its mostly written to:
 * 1. Show how simple it is to use the API from Lesson 1 and 2 to create a small layer on top that is very simple to use and also quite small (look at {@link Player} class.
 * 2. Have a very comprehensive way to run pre-built tests.
 *
 * You see pretty much the essence of Pax Exam packed into a very small space:
 * - add Options
 * - add Tests/Probe
 * .. and you are ready to "play" (see  {@link org.ops4j.pax.exam.player.Player#play()}
 *
 * This can be used anywhere, not only in JUnit tests.
