/**
 * Your first "probe". Well not really Probe. Its the class that will be put in a jar on-the-fly.
 * Pax Exam will calculate a fairly relaxed Manifest Metadata for you.
 * You don't have access to the manifest at this point.
 *
 * Everything that you use (classes) must be exported by other bundles in your setup.
 * Its import to understand that this class will be put into a bundle, possibly transfered to another JVM (depending on which TestContainer you pick), and executed remotly.
 * Consider this, specially regarding Exceptions, Parameters etc.
 *
 * A Probe must also have a public no argument constructor, like the one you get by default (no -constructor specified).
 *
 * Tests that are being add later must have public visibility.
 *
 * Parameters:
 * They have a special meaning.
 * You can have:
 * - no argument
 * - BundleContext, which you will get from the OSGi Runtime
 * - BundlContext + more parameters: those are being passed in at "call" time. Specially useful when writing tests that are being re-used. This gives you some flexibility.
